I am one of two TAs for Math 2250 in Fall 2025. My responsibilities include holding office hours (~4 hours a week), grading, managing the graders and assigning grading assignments, overseeing undergraduate peer tutors' and aiding their office hours (~10 hours a week of additional teaching), and aiding in exam preparation and proctoring. I was incredibly involved in this course, including attending peer tutors' office hours to assist, lecturing as a substitute for the course, and writing exam problems. I received extremely positive course evaluations (an average rating of 4.35, significantly above the department average).
