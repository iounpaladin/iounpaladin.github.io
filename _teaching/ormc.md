I have been teaching at the Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle as a Lead Instructor from Fall 2021-present. Iâ€™ve led classes for students aged 11-18 and introduced them to advanced mathematical topics such as group theory, random walks, and combinatorial game theory. I worked on curriculum development, instructor training, and administration alongside my teaching duties.
