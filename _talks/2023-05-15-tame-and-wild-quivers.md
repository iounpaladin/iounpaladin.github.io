I presented a talk at the UCLA Quiver Representations Seminar on Tame and Wild Quivers. Following Chapter 7 of Kirillov's *Quiver Representations and Quiver Varieties*, I introduced the definitions of tame and wild quivers, the tame-wild dichotomy (due to Drozd), and introduced the necessary technology to prove a connected quiver is tame iff it is Euclidean: affine Kac-Moody algebras and their root systems, affine Coxeter elements, and defect classification of preprojective/preinjective/regular representations.
