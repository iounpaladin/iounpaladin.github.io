I presented a talk at the [UCLA Number Theory Participating Seminar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jaswenberg/ntlearning/ntlearning23W.html) on the Fargues-Fontaine Curve. Following Scholze's Berkeley Notes, I introduced the Fargues-Fontaine curve from three perspectives: as a curve parametrising the untilts of a perfectoid ring, as a special "period ring," and finally as a diamond, unifying the previous concepts.
