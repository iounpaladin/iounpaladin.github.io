I presented a talk at the UCLA Infinity Categories Seminar on Limits, Colimits, and their Constructions. Following Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of Riehl-Verity's [*Elements of Infinity Category Theory*](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/elements.pdf), I introduced diagram infinity-categories, defined limits and colimits in the infinity-categorical setting, and proved the preservation of limits by right adjoints.
