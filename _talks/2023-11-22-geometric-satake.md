At the UCLA Geometric Langlands Seminar, I introduced the Geometric Satake Correspondence by defining Tannakian categories, describing the basics of Tannakian reconstruction, and sketching a (very vague) proof of the correspondence via MirkoviÄ‡-Vilonen's approach. 

Notes are available [here](https://max.steinbergfour.com/files/satake.pdf). The talk was recorded and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_iFcDro5pE).
