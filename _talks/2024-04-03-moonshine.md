I organised the UCLA Participating Algebra Seminar in Spring 2024. We discussed Monstrous Moonshine, and I introduced the seminar by giving a broad description of the pieces in Moonshine and how they fit together.

Notes are available [here](https://max.steinbergfour.com/files/moonshine.pdf). The talk was recorded and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkaKgoDZqHo).
