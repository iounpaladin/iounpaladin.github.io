At the UCLA Summer Quiver Representations Seminar, I started off the seminar by introducing classical McKay Correspondence. Starting from the classification of finite subgroups of SU(2) via spherical polyhedra, I detailed the construction of the McKay quiver and the ADE classification associated to it.

Notes are available [here](https://max.steinbergfour.com/files/McKay_Correspondence_I.pdf). The talk was recorded and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4vfRDdNWF0).
