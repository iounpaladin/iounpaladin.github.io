Hi! My name is Max and I am a 5th year undergraduate at UCLA studying Representation Theory. We don't have advisors in undergrad at UCLA, but if we did, mine would be [Raphaël Rouquier](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~rouquier/). 

# Interests
I am interested in geometric representation theory broadly, and specifically interested in the geometric Langlands programme. 

# List of Resources I Like
- [π-base](https://topology.pi-base.org/)
- [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/)
- [ATLAS](https://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/)

To be expanded!
