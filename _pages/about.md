# About Me
Hi! My name is Max and I am a 5th year undergraduate at UCLA studying Representation Theory. We don't have advisors in undergrad at UCLA, but if we did, mine would be [Raphaël Rouquier](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~rouquier/). 

# Interests
I am interested in representation theory broadly, and in particular, higher categorical quiver representations and geometric representation theory (particularly in positive characteristic). I am currently working on a project in quiver representation theory, attempting to generalise McKay Correspondence via triality of G_2. 

# List of Resources I Like
