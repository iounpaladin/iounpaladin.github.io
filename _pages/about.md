Hi! My name is Max and I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at Yale University, studying geometric representation theory. I am advised by [Sam Raskin](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~sr2532/)!

I did my B.S. and M.A. at UCLA. We don't officially have advisors in undergrad at UCLA, but I worked with [Raphaël Rouquier](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~rouquier/) unoffcially. 

# Interests
I am interested in geometric representation theory broadly, and specifically interested in W-algebras, vertex algebras, and Kac-Moody representations at the critical level, in the context of the geometric Langlands programme. I am currently learning about W-algebras and relations to the geometric Langlands programme. 

# Some Fun Tools
- [π-base](https://topology.pi-base.org/)
- [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/)
- [ATLAS](https://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/)

# What I'm Reading
- [Langlands Correspondence for Loop Groups](https://math.berkeley.edu/~frenkel/loop.pdf)
- [W-Algebras and Whittaker Categories](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~sr2532/whit.pdf)
- Vertex Algebras and Algebraic Curves (Ben-Zvi--Frenkel)
- (Soon) Chiral Algebras (Beilinson-Drinfeld)
- (Someday) [Proof of the Geometric Langlands Conjecture](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/gaitsgde/GLC/)

To be expanded!
